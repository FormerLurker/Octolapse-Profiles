  "description": "Takes a snapshot on every layer with an emphasis on speed.  This trigger always chooses the closest position, which is usually an extrusion, and can cause significant artifacts/quality issues.  However, this trigger can be useful if your print contains a wipe tower that is the closest object on your print to the selected stabilization point, or if there is an ooze shield around the print.\n\nThe smart trigger pre-processes your gcode in order to choose better stabilization points, reducing travel time.  This trigger is configured for compatibility with different slicers and printers.",
